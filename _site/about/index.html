    <p>PICTURE  I’m David Stempien.  I am originally from Quincy, MI, USA.  I graduated from Quincy High School in 1991, then went to college at Eastern Michigan University where I studied computer science and mathematics.  During my time there I began working as a student technician for University Computing. Following graduation, I began working full-time for the University in a couple of different roles:  First, as the IT administrator for the College of Technology, then later returning to University Computing as a lead administrator supporting the university in desktop support and in network and systems administration.  I had a great time there, worked with many great friends, but felt like I needed a new opportunity to grow.</p>

<p>In 1998 I took a job working for the University of Michigan as a network administrator for IT Communications.  I worked in that role for 8 years wherein I learned a TON about networks and worked with some really great minds.  During this time I met my wife Debra, had two boys, and built a new house.The cost of living in Ann Arbor prevented us from having the life we really wanted.  So, in 2006…</p>

<p>I took a security analyst role for the University of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester, NY.  We packed up our house, said goodbye to our family and friends in Michigan, and moved (literally overnight!) to New York where we’ve been to this day.  We were lucky enough to purchase the house my wife grew up in and which was built by her family.  This is exacly the life we wanted: big ranch, 2 rural acres, good schools, and just close enough to a major city.</p>

<p>I worked 8 years for the UR Medical Center, initially as a network security analyst, and later also adding the role of a lead network analyst.  This was a good position that allowed our family to relocate, but I really missed supporting the academic environment, so in 2014 I shifted to another role within the university at Univesity IT.  I am currently the lead network engineer for the University of Rochester supporting both the academic and medical campuses and regional affiliates for all things telecommunications.</p>

<p>What’s next?</p>

<p>While I do quite a bit of programming in supporting and automating my work today, I really wish I had opporunity to do more.  The day-to-day demands of my job don’t offer me enough time to grow more in programming, and the same goes for my free time away from work.  I am polishing up on modern techniques (goodbye Pascal, Perl, C; hello HTML, JS, PHP, Python, and Ruby).  For the next 4-5 years both of my boys will be in college, so I still need the stability of a guaranteed income and benefits, but who knows what the future offers afterwards?  I dream of having a large 2-story pole barn for work &amp; play, and I would love to have a big dog to keep me company.  Sadly, due to allergies within the family we cannot have pets within our home.  I think this would make a fine transition into retirement.</p>
